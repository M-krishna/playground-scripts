# Logic gates
Consider we are given the "nand" gate by God. We have to build all the other combinational gates using the nand gate.

## Logic gates to build
* AND
* OR
* NOT
* NAND (already given by god)
* NOR
* XOR
* XNOR

## Basic Arithmetic circuits
* Half Adder
* Full Adder
* Half Subtractor
* Full Subtractor
