Step by step walkthrough in phases
----------------------------------

Phase 1: Master the fundamentals
--------------------------------

1. Convert basic arithmetic functions to CPS
2. Transform conditional logic (if/else) to CPS
3. Convert simple loops to CPS recursion

Practice exercises:
-------------------
* Factorial function (normal -> CPS)
* Fibonacci sequence
* Array operations (map, filter, reduce) in CPS
* Simple calculator that chains operations
