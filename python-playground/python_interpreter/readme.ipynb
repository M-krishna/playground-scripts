There are still some gaps in our mental model though. In the example above, the last instruction is `RETURN_VALUE` which corresponds to the `return` statement in the code. But where does the instruction return to?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question. we must add a layer of complexity: **the frame**. A frame is a collection of information and context for a chuck of code. Frames are created and destroyed on the fly as your Python code executes. There's one frame corresponding to each *call* of a function - so each frame has one code object associated with it, a code object can have many frames. If you had a function that called itself recursively ten times, you'd have eleven frames - one for each level of recursion and one for the module you started from. In general, there's a frame for each scope in a Python program. For example, each module, each function call, and each class definition has a frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frames live on a *call stack*, a completely different stack from the ones we've been discussing so far. (The call stack is the stack you're most familiar with already) - you've seen it printed out in the tracebacks of exceptions. Each line in the traceback starting with \"File 'program.py', line 10\" corresponds to one frame on the call stack.). The stack we've been examining - the one the interpreter is manipulating while it executes bytecode - we'll call the *data stack*. There's also a third stack, called the *block stack*. Blocks are used for certain kind of control flow, particularly looping and exception handling. Each frame on the call stack has its own data stack and block stack.\n",
