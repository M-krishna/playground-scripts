    "### What is an Event loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "An event loop is a programming pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. It's the central mechanism that allows a single-threaded program to perform non-blocking operations, particularly I/O bound tasks like network requests, file operations or user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problems event loop solves\n",
    "\n",
    "Before event loops, we had two main approaches to handle multiple operations:\n",
    "1. Sequencial (blocking) execution\n",
    "2. Thread-based concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequencial (blocking) execution\n",
    "Operations happen one after another. While waiting for slow operation (like reading a file), the entire program blocks, wasting CPU time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread-based concurrency\n",
    "Create a new thread for each operation. This introduces complexity with thread management, synchronization and resource consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The event loop offers a middle ground: a single-threaded model that can handle multiple operations concurrently without blocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before Event Loops\n",
    "Let's consider a simple webserver before event loops\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Traditional blocking server (simplified) \n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    connection = accept_connection()    # blocks until client connects\n",
    "    data = connection.receive()         # blocks until data arrives\n",
    "    result = process_data(data)         # CPU processing\n",
    "    connection.send(result)             # Blocks until data is send\n",
    "    connection.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This server can only handle one client at a time. It reading data takes 3 seconds then other clients must wait\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Loop Concepts\n",
    "An event loop consists of several key components:\n",
    "1. Event Queue: Stores events (tasks) waiting to be processed.\n",
    "2. Event loop: Continuously checks for events and processes them.\n",
    "3. Event handlers/callbacks: Functions that run when an event occurs\n",
    "4. Non-blocking I/O: Operations that don't block the main thread"
